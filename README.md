# googleAutoFill
## Description
*This was a really fun project to do. It was actually an assignment by my teacher.* 😀
### what it actually does ?
Here we go, it automates the google form filling, so we cool folks 😎 don't have to fill it
over and over same data. 
### How to use it ? 
1. Just update `details.json` file with your personal information.
2. pass on google form link to app, submit it and voila.
3. Done, no more steps.
### Bro just tell me the tools used, i'll give it a shot too.
It doesn't use much other than following:
- python 3 or above
- tkinter
- selenium
- geckodriver
- and other small tools that i forgot cause i am writing this few years later.

Peace out ✌️!
